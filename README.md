# Percolation

This is a simple implementation of the Newman-Ziff algorithm written in Python. This repository was motivated by the lecture series "Percolation and Related Topics" given by Prof. Robert M. Ziff in "National Summer School on Statistical Physics, 2018" at Satyendra Nath Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences, Kolkata. The topic of the school was: "Introducing Research Topics of Statistical Physics To Young Physicists".
